# 7. Reference Firmware Implementations

The maintained, buildable firmware is the canonical implementation:
[browse the source tree](https://github.com/gloveboxes/Z80ROMlessSBC/tree/main/src)
or use the [complete source index](../reference/source-index.md). The
corresponding [implementation phase pages](../implementation/index.md) provide
design-level excerpts for
the safety invariants and integration order: variable-frequency clock
generation, bus acquisition, synchronous I/O trapping, flash image loading,
and terminal integration. Do not copy those excerpts in place of the
maintained source.

## 7.1 Firmware and CP/M Build

The repository implements the ten cumulative firmware stages under `src/`.
Stage 10 includes the journaled flash disks, CP/M boot loader, and WebSocket
terminal. Its host build also assembles the board-native CP/M 2.2 BIOS,
reconstructs pristine CCP/BDOS bytes from the preserved Altair source image,
and emits all provisionable images.

Install CMake, Ninja, Python 3, `picotool`, and `z80asm`. The firmware needs a
complete Arm GNU bare-metal toolchain with Newlib; the Homebrew compiler alone
does not provide the required runtime. A known working setup is:

```sh
brew install cmake ninja picotool z80asm
export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/arm-gnu-toolchain-15.3.rel1/bin:$PATH"
cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
  -DPICO_BOARD=pico2_w \
  -DZ80_WIFI_SSID='your-network' \
  -DZ80_WIFI_PASSWORD='your-password'
cmake --build build --target z80_cpm_images -j
```

Wi-Fi credentials are written only to the generated build tree. An empty SSID
leaves networking disabled while flash-disk service continues to operate. The
`z80_cpm_images` target builds Stage 10 and writes these files to `build/cpm/`:

| Artifact | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `z80boot.pkg` | Manifest, CRCs, and the reset-ready 64 KiB Z80 image |
| `drive_a_cpm63k-z80.img` | Native CP/M system disk with the Z80 SBC BIOS |
| `drive_b_bdsc.img` through `drive_d_blank.img` | Converted 320 KiB disks |
| `z80romless-flash.bin` | Complete 4 MiB initial-provisioning image |
| `manifest.json` | Geometry, addresses, sizes, and SHA-256 values |

Run the host regression checks with:

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s src/cpm -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

## 7.2 Flash Provisioning

For a new or disposable flash, put the Pico in BOOTSEL mode and write the
complete image. This erases existing CP/M disk contents and the journal:

```sh
picotool load -v build/cpm/z80romless-flash.bin -t bin -o 0x10000000
picotool reboot
```

For normal updates, load only the firmware and selected storage regions. These
commands preserve regions not named by the input file:

```sh
picotool load -v build/src/stage10_websocket_terminal/z80_stage10_websocket_terminal.uf2
picotool load -v build/cpm/z80boot.pkg -t bin -o 0x102A0000
picotool load -v build/cpm/drive_a_cpm63k-z80.img -t bin -o 0x102C0000
picotool load -v build/cpm/drive_b_bdsc.img -t bin -o 0x10310000
picotool load -v build/cpm/drive_c_escape.img -t bin -o 0x10360000
picotool load -v build/cpm/drive_d_blank.img -t bin -o 0x103B0000
picotool reboot
```

After association, browse to `http://<pico-dhcp-address>:8088/`. The USB serial
console reports Stage 10 startup and accepts `s` to print terminal queue/drop
counts and disk/fatal status. CP/M disk writes are persistent, so retain host
backups before full reprovisioning.
